I am a first-year Ph.D student in Deparment of Computer Engineering, University of Virginia. Before joining UVA in June, 2022, I obtained my Master of Science degree in the ECE department at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and Bachalor degree of Electrical engineering and automation in [Chongqing University](http://english.cqu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Homa Alemzadeh](https://homa-alem.github.io/index.html). My research interests lie in machine learning appilcations, especially **Natural Language Procesing (NLP)**.


## My work and research
I'm working on the project "Cognitive Assistant Systems for Emergency Response". Our team collects electronic Patient Care Reports(ePCR) data on Emergency Medical Service (EMS) domain, we are utilizing the data to help build an end-to-end *Cognitive Assistant* to help support real-time, accurate decision making for first responders.
