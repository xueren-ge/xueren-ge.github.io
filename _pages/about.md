I am a first-year Ph.D student in Deparment of Computer Engineering, University of Virginia. Before joining UVA in June, 2022, I obtained my Master of Science degree in the ECE department at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and Bachalor degree of Electrical engineering and automation in [Chongqing University](http://english.cqu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Homa Alemzadeh](https://homa-alem.github.io/index.html). My research interests lie in machine learning appilcations, especially **Natural Language Procesing (NLP)**.

I'm also interested in taking photos and traveling. Recently I'm learning how to do stargazing and taking galaxy photograph, and plan to taking galaxy photos during this summer. Check [my photo account](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/598330855e87e72a74bd33b1) to see and discuss how to take photos.
