I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. Before joining UVA in June 2022, I obtained my Master of Science degree in the ECE Department at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Chongqing University](http://english.cqu.edu.cn/). I'm working with Prof. [Homa Alemzadeh](https://homa-alem.github.io/index.html). My research interests lie in machine learning applications, especially **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I am currently working on information seeking in medical conversations, diagnosis prediction, and large language models (LLMs) for the medical domain.

I'm also interested in photography and travel. My main photo account is on [Rednote](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/598330855e87e72a74bd33b1) — follow me, and let's discuss how to capture moments through the camera!
