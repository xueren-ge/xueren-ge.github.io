Aurora and Milky Way at May 11, best experience ever. I was so shocked when finding the galactic center was red and double checked if my camera CMOS had any problems. But then I faced the north and saw the red lights in the sky and suddenly realized it was aurora.

Although the temperature in Shenandoah mountains is pretty low but I still enjoy the night with the old barn, singing of birds, let alone the gentle breezes among the mountains.

The photo is taken in Blue Ridge Parkway, Virginia, I used Canon R6 35mm F2.8 ISO 800 tracked sky x8, and the foreground x5
